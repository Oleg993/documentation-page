        <h2>Grid</h2>
        <h3>Grids</h3>
        <p>
          CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It
          lets you lay content out in rows and columns. It has many features
          that make building complex layouts straightforward. This article will
          explain all you need to know to get started with page layout.
        </p>
        <h3>What is grid layout?</h3>
        <p>
          A grid is a collection of horizontal and vertical lines creating a
          pattern against which we can line up our design elements. They help us
          to create layouts in which our elements won't jump around or change
          width as we move from page to page, providing greater consistency on
          our websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          A grid will typically have columns, rows, and then gaps between each
          row and column. The gaps are commonly referred to as gutters.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating your grid in CSS</h3>
        <p>
          Having decided on the grid that your design needs, you can use CSS
          Grid Layout to create it. We'll look at the basic features of Grid
          Layout first and then explore how to create a simple grid system for
          your project.
        </p>
        <h3>Defining a grid</h3>
        <p>
          As a starting point, download and open the starting point file in your
          text editor and browser (you can also see it live here). You will see
          an example with a container, which has some child items. These display
          in normal flow by default, so the boxes display one below the other.
          We'll be working with this file for the first part of this lesson,
          making changes to see how its grid behaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          To define a grid we use the grid value of the display property. As
          with Flexbox, this enables Grid Layout; all of the direct children of
          the container become grid items. Add this to the CSS inside your file
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike Flexbox, the items will not immediately look any different.
          Declaring display: grid gives you a one column grid, so your items
          will continue to display one below the other as they do in normal
          flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          To see something that looks more grid-like, we'll need to add some
          columns to the grid. Let's add three 200-pixel columns. You can use
          any length unit or percentage to create these column tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add the second declaration to your CSS rule, then reload the page. You
          should see that the items have rearranged themselves such that there's
          one in each cell of the grid.
        </p>
        <h3>Flexible grids with the fr unit</h3>
        <p>
          Change your track listing to the following definition, creating three
          1fr tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should now see that you have flexible tracks. The fr unit
          distributes space proportionally. So if you specify different positive
          values for your tracks like so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first track now gets 2fr of the available space and the other two
          tracks get 1fr, making the first track larger. You can mix fr units
          with fixed length units â€” in such a case the space needed for the
          fixed tracks is used up first; the remaining space is then distributed
          to the other tracks.
        </p>
        <h3>Gaps between tracks</h3>
        <p>
          To create gaps between tracks we use the properties column-gap for
          gaps between columns, row-gap for gaps between rows, and gap as a
          shorthand for both.
        </p>
        <h3>Repeating track listings</h3>
        <p>
          You can repeat all or merely a section of your track listing using the
          CSS repeat() function. Change your track listing to the following.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll now get three 1fr tracks just as before. The first value passed
          to the repeat() function specifies the number of times you want the
          listing to repeat, while the second value is a track listing, which
          may be one or more tracks that you want to repeat.
