        <h2>Flexbox</h2>
        <h3>Flexbox</h3>
        <p>
          Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows
          or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to
          fit into smaller spaces. This article explains all the fundamentals.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Flexbox?</h3>
        <p>
          For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools
          available for creating CSS layouts were features like floats and
          positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and
          frustrating.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible
          to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
          <li>
            Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of
            the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is
            available.
          </li>
          <li>
            Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height
            even if they contain a different amount of content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout
          tasks much easier. Let's dig in!
        </p>
        <h3>Introducing a simple example</h3>
        <p>
          In this article, you'll work through a series of exercises to help you
          understand how flexbox works. To get started, you should make a local
          copy of the first starter file â€” flexbox0.html from our GitHub repo.
          Load it in a modern browser (like Firefox or Chrome) and have a look
          at the code in your code editor. You can also see it live here.
        </p>
        <h3>The flex model:</h3>
        <p>
          When elements are laid out as flex items, they are laid out along two
          axes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The main axis is the axis running in the direction the flex items
            are laid out in (for example, as a row across the page, or a column
            down the page.) The start and end of this axis are called the main
            start and main end.
          </li>
          <li>
            The cross axis is the axis running perpendicular to the direction
            the flex items are laid out in. The start and end of this axis are
            called the cross start and cross end.
          </li>
          <li>
            The parent element that has display: flex set on it is called the
            flex container.
          </li>
          <li>
            The items laid out as flexible boxes inside the flex container are
            called flex items.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Bear this terminology in mind as you go through subsequent sections.
          You can always refer back to it if you get confused about any of the
          terms being used.
        </p>
        <h3>Columns or rows?</h3>
        <p>
          Flexbox provides a property called flex-direction that specifies which
          direction the main axis runs (which direction the flexbox children are
          laid out in). By default this is set to row, which causes them to be
          laid out in a row in the direction your browser's default language
          works in (left to right, in the case of an English browser).
        </p>
        <h3>Wrapping</h3>
        <p>
          One issue that arises when you have a fixed width or height in your
          layout is that eventually your flexbox children will overflow their
          container, breaking the layout. Have a look at our flexbox-wrap0.html
          example and try viewing it live.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now have multiple rows. Each row has as many flexbox children
          fitted into it as is sensible. Any overflow is moved down to the next
          line. The flex: 200px declaration set on the articles means that each
          will be at least 200px wide. We'll discuss this property in more
          detail later on. You might also notice that the last few children on
          the last row are each made wider so that the entire row is still
          filled.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there's more we can do here. First of all, try changing your
          flex-direction property value to row-reverse. Now you'll see that you
          still have your multiple row layout, but it starts from the opposite
          corner of the browser window and flows in reverse.
